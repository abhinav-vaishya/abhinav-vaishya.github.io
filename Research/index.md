### Research Interests
- Quantum Error-Correcting Codes, specifically erasure decoding of Quantum LDPC codes.
- Graph-based Codes
- Combinatorial and Algorithmic Problems in Coding Theory
- Codes for Distributed Storage
- Applying Combinatorics and Coding-Theoretic ideas to problems in Broadcast Communications \
(e.g., Coded Caching, Coded Data Rebalancing, Coded Distributed Computing, etc.)



### Publications

#### Preprints / Under Review


- <em>Coded Data Rebalancing for Distributed Data Storage Systems with Cyclic Storage, </em>preprint, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory (TIT).<br>
<strong>Abhinav Vaishya</strong>, Athreya Chandramouli, Srikar Kale, Prasad Krishnan<br>
[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06257">arXiv</a>]<br><br>
We present coded data rebalancing schemes for the single node-removal and node-addition scenarios in replication-based distributed data storage systems with cyclic storage. We also derive a lower bound for the single node-removal scenario.

We present new coded caching and distributed computing schemes using binary matrices arising out of combinatorial designs and their q-analogs (subspace designs).<br><br>

#### Conferences

- <em>On the Efficacy of the Peeling Decoder for the Quantum Expander Code, </em>IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), 2025.<br>
Jefrin Sharmitha Prabhu*, <strong> Abhinav Vaishya*</strong>, Shobhit Bhatnagar, Aryaman Manish Kolhe, V. Lalitha, P. Vijay Kumar<br>
[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21845">arXiv</a>]<br><br>
We study the efficacy of the peeling decoder for a class of Hypergraph Product Codes, known as Quantum Expander Codes. We also modify the Small-Set-Flip (SSF) algorithm to work with erasures, which is employed after the peeling procedure to correct the remaining errors.
