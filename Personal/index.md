Below are some (non-academic) interests that came to my mind while writing this.

#### Running
Since early childhood, I have been a (good enough) sprinter. Recently (around November 2023), I got into long-distance running and I have been mostly quite consistent. I also lift weights regularly to enhance my running efficiency and performance.

#### Climbing
I had my first climbing session in January 2023. Absolutely loved it. Since then, I've been into climbing (not as seriously as running though).

#### Trekking/Hiking
I've always loved mountains. In October 2023, I did my first (kind-of) long trek in Himachal Pradesh, India. After that, I did a few short treks in southern India. I plan to go on many more!

#### Cricket
Since childhood, I have been very much into cricket. My favourite player is Virat Kohli. I also play cricket whenever I get a chance. I like both - batting and bowling.

#### Languages
I am into learning languages (also a bit into etymology). Currently, I am learning French and German.

#### Art Cinema
During the covid lockdown period, I watched a lot of art films (mostly foreign-language and old). I do watch more once in a while. Some of my favourites are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_400_Blows">The 400 Blows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film)">Mulholland Drive</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chungking_Express">Chungking Express</a>. 

#### Rock Music
Seems like I like everything rock (context: climbing). I am really into Rock music and I listen to various subgenres of it.
